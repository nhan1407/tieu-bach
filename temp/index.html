<h2>Survive in desert</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game mostly use the  timer feature of phaser 3, which help create a variation of random time delay in either miliseconds or seconds. 
It also uses the class group feature which help spawning mutilple water bottle
It also uses CreateCursorKeys function to recieve input and help player move character
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
In the beginning, I plant to make a top-down shooter game with top down mechanics example from phaser. However, I struggle with spawning more troops to fight, and I don't have much time left, so I end up with simplize it into a collector game. I have learn a lot about group this week. The hardest part (which I still not figure it out) is spawinng troop for now. I also want to learn how to make enemy chasing my character as well (which would be great for a dungeon game)
These are techniques that I have learnt from this assignment:

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It come from a Phaser 3 example
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You try to survive by collecting water bottle, until you found the oasis
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is oasis. It can be counted as 3 objects (player, potion, oasis) as well
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this games, it can be an RPG game with collector playstyle, key board input and a lot of randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Controlling character and dealing with acceleration.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
The little secret here is that I use acceleration instead of velocity to move character, so player must also deal with it as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Since it just a minigame, so I don't think it take a paragraph for a tutorial. Everything you need to do is move your character to collect water to survive until the oasis appear
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Strategie here could be collecting bottle that far away first then collect bottles closer later, mutiple bottle near each other can help you full fill health that you were lost. If you do opposite in early game, health will hit the max capacity and waste your time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
	Player get lost in a desert, they must collect as much water as possible to survive before he reach the oasis
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
It would be kid and young teenager.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
It should take sometime around 10 seconds for each round.
</li>
